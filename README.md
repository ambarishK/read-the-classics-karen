Classic citations for single-cell RNA-seq oriented people. Famous datasets, R packages, python modules and so on. 

Inspired by awesome single-cell RNA seq lists such as: 
* https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell
* https://github.com/crazyhottommy/RNA-seq-analysis#single-cell-rna-seq
* https://github.com/agitter/single-cell-pseudotime

And https://www.scrna-tools.org/. I decided to make my own list. Not of repos, or tools, but... citations! 

We have to read a lot to get updated in this single-cell RNA-seq world, so I decided to read all the classic citations. This names that keep popping up, you know? Like "Trapnell, 2014", "Butler, 2018" and so on. Articles about single-cell RNA-seq, or a core concepts in the field (such as the papers describing UMAP or tSNE).

I'm basically telling myself: read the classics, Karen!


## What is a "classic citation"?

There are some people that try to really systematize what a "citation classic" is. Look at how many Google Scholar results about it (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=CITATION+CLASSICS&btnG=). Wow

I plan to read more about in the theoretical future, but for now, I will be more practical. 



Let's start with the *big classics* in single cells.

# Big Classics
Papers with > 800 citations in Google Scholar


### 2014
* Trapnell et al, [The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2859)
